### THIS IS YOUR README

This is my final_clock.

This clock design is based on my sketch. And this is my final version.
At the end, I add some particles to show the motions, this idea comes from the p5.js -> Examples -> Simulate -> Particles (https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-particles.html). 
The theme of this clock is water. The water drops, the waves and the circle particles, all of them were designed into this clock as part of water. And the colours are all kinds of blue. 
For the sine wave, I tried many times to count the correct maths equations. And I also want to show the correct time in this clock, so I add numbers on the clock.
